Murder ain't exactly difficult to get away with right now. | But you already know that, don't you?"],"openers":["You find the bastard yet?","...What?  What do you want?","Are you here for art, chocolate, or questioning?"],"openersMorning":["Morning Detective, it is too early for many questions..."],"openersNight":["...It's too late for chocolate, you must be here for questions.","I just put away all my pieces. What do you want?"],"closers":["Don't look at me like that.  I get enough bad looks as it is.","Yeah.","What?  That's it?"],"closersMorning":["Good day to you too..."],"closersDay":["Not even gonna buy something?  Really?"],"closersNight":["Night, detective. "],"itemYes":["Yes, I have [Weapon].  Is that your major breakthrough here?","Yes, genius, I carry [Weapon].","And you don't have [Weapon]?"],"itemNo":["Now that you mention it, I can't find my [Weapon].  I first realized that it was gone early yesterday.  ","Yeah, no.  Try again.","Hate to break it to you, but your lead just dead-ended.  I don't have [Weapon]."],"itemBut":["If you want to use your brain, why not ask where [Suspect] got [Weapon].  ","So what?  [Suspect] has [Weapon], and I don't see you questioning [Suspect].","We all have something that could have done it.  Hell, even [Suspect] has [Weapon].","Where'd you get that information?  It was [Suspect], wasn't it? | Well, you know what?  Just yesterday I saw [Suspect] with [Weapon]. | Go bother [Suspect] about that."],"startHintYes":["%(sigh)% What a mess. | Look into [Suspect].  I know [Suspect] has [Weapon]."],"startHintNo":["%(sigh)% What a mess. | I know nothing, detective.  Ask someone else."],"motiveGreenInnocent":["[Green] is one of the few people in this town who can accept differences.  That's rare in this world.","The fancy guy?  Oh yeah, he purchases art from me every few weeks. | He always says he comes to see my artistic vision.","Of all the rich people, [Green]'s not so bad."],"motiveGreenGuilty":["%Tch.%  [Green] may seem nice, but he's just as dirty as any other rich person.","The deist?  He doesn't even trust the bible. | Just like a businessman.","Would you trust a man like that?"],"motiveYellowInnocent":["[Yellow]?  We're practically competing, yet she always visits to support me.  Doesn't get better than that.","[Yellow]?  She practically advertises my supplies in her store like we ain't competing. | The lady's got guts at least.","[Yellow] and I don't see eye to eye, but I honestly can't complain."],"motiveYellowGuilty":["Pft, [Yellow]?  She seems nice, but she ain't going to heaven, I'll tell you that much.","The baker?  She doesn't seem all that great.  What does [Blue] see in her, anyway?","The baker?  That devil's been leading [Blue] astray ever since her husband died."],"motiveRedInnocent":["You'll call me [Red].  I'm a chocolateer, an artist, an artisan, and a street merchant. | You'll see me doing the latter the most though.  Here, take a chocolate sample. | Now what do you want?"],"motiveRedGuilty":[null],"motiveBlackInnocent":["He never seems to trust me, but [Black]'s one of the only honest catholics around.","He's the head of my church.  Enough said.","[Black]'s been putting my art in the church for years.  He says I have a gift of God. | Hm, I can't complain with that."],"motiveBlackGuilty":["What, [Black]?  He looks at me as a threat to his job. | I don't even want to be a friar, just for him to retire. | He's getting too old and cranky to do street crying every day.","What, [Black]?  Yeah, no.  He's a tired, old friar. | I'm just waiting for God to take notice and find his replacement."],"motiveBlueInnocent":["[Blue]?  He's the only one I can't complain about.  He's a good guy that I'd like to get to know better.","[Blue]'s a great catholic guy.  What else do I have to say?","[Blue] always stops by at closing to walk me home.  He's surprisingly sweet, if not a great judge of character."],"motiveBlueGuilty":["[Blue]?  I don't have an issue with [Blue].  I have an issue with [Blue] letting [Yellow] poison his mind. | What does [Blue] see in [Yellow] anyway?  Can't he see that she's not interested?","I like [Blue].  Out of everyone in this town, [Blue]'s passable.  That said, [Blue] never gives me the time of day. | So yeah, I'm mad at him.","Maybe if [Blue] pulled himself out of the gutter more often, then he'd actually have the chance to be the person I know he could be."],"motiveVictimGreenInnocent":["[Green] has the money to expedite [Victim]'s services when needed. | %must be nice having money.%"],"motiveVictimGreenGuilty":["Feh, [Victim] only served [Green] because they were paid to. They disagreed basically everything else."],"motiveVictimYellowInnocent":["Oh, please. [Yellow] wouldn't ever /\"dislike/\" someone.

They were always bringing me neat little trinkets to trade for my crafts."],"motiveVictimRedGuilty":["I think [Victim] bought things from me just to turn around and charge me for medical services. | [Victim] wasn't exactly the most curtious of shoppers though.  Always bringing up how I've done something wrong by worshiping God."],"motiveVictimBlackInnocent":["The friar may be angry, though I doubt he'd publicly condone someone that's done at least some good for the town."],"motiveVictimBlackGuilty":["[Black]'s getting old, I think [Victim] saw that and told him. [Black] looks... angrier when [Victim] was around."],"motiveVictimBlueInnocent":["%Tch.% [Blue] spends his whole day at [Yellow]'s bakery every day that the doctor's in town. | He must think the doctor's gonna fix everything around here while he wastes time with [Yellow]."],"motiveVictimBlueGuilty":["I hear [Yellow]'s got a thing for [Victim], as messed up as that sounds. | So yeah, you guessed it, [Blue] hates him. | %(sigh)%"],"opportunityGreenGuilty":["Fancy pants?
