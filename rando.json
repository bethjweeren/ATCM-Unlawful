What a thought! | If I had half a mind I'd save this blackmail for a rainy day.","What is [Blue] doing?  A murder happens in his town, and all he can think about is drinking! | ...On second thought, maybe he's got the right idea.","I went to one of [Victim1]'s speeches the other day.  No wonder Green Wine's in trouble. | I nearly quit wine myself after hearing it! | ...Nearly.","[Blue] may enjoy the company of women, but he doesn't seem any less shy with some of the men. | Is [Black] correct to say that drinks can cloud the soul as well as the mind?","Uh, who are you again?  Do I know you?","Does [Black] really have the right to blame the whole town for the murder? | What, tell him?  I, uh.  I think I'll tell him later.","[Yellow]'s a saint in how she treats everyone here, but I'm always a little offput by her. | I'm not pessimistic, am I?","I've never seen [Yellow] be anything less than chipper.  |  Some say she's never cried, even when her husband died!

","[Green]'s family's been connected to wine for so long, I wouldn't be surprised if his ancestors were vampires.","For such a small town, it sure does seem like there are a lot of freemason lodges. | Oh, uh, you didn't know that?  ","[Yellow]'s like the town's grandmother. | Overly kind and constantly feeding us.","I heard that [Black] and [Green] used to be friends before [Green] became a Deist. | No wonder [Green] avoids the town square during the day."],"closers":[]}
