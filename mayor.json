{"introductions":["Ah, detective.  You received my letter I assume? | Have you checked [Victim]'s body for clues yet?  It should be at [Location]. | Oh, and be sure to speak with the suspects: [Black], [Red], [Yellow], [Green], and [Blue].  They were all missing from last night's festivities at town hall, as well as [Victim] of course. | But I'm sure you know all of this.  Have you already made a solid case for who could have killed [Victim]?"],"openers":["Welcome back, detective.  How is your case going so far?  Can you tell me who you think did it?","You're here to present your findings I assume?  Who do you think could have killed [Victim]?","This town doesn't have a lot of murders, detective.  I hope that the case you make is solid. | Speaking of which, have you discovered who was capable of murdering [Victim]?"],"closers":["Well, figure it out soon, detective.  We only have so long before dread sets in. | Maybe you should give the body another look.  Not every clue is as obvious as it seems.","If you're having trouble deciding, perhaps you should ask the suspects about each other.  They have known each other longer, after all.","You seem perplexed detective, if you're torn, try talking to some townsfolk.  Many of them have known the suspects longer than you."]}
