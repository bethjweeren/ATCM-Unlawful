Including a company that has a need for [Weapon]."],"itemNo":["Have you any proof, detective?","It is impolite to ... slander, detective.

Something to do that is not ... uncommon. | However, I cannot think of where to start.  I appologize."],"motiveGreenInnocent":["I am [Green] Greenston, the vintner of the town and producer of the nationally ... famous Green Wine.  You can call me [Green]. | I am often at the vinyard to the East, but I am often busy.  Take that into account. | This case will hurt sales for Green Wine as much as it will harm your reputation if you cannot find the murderer. | For this reason and more, Green Wine appreciates your ... hard work."],"motiveGreenGuilty":[null],"motiveYellowInnocent":["[Yellow] is a consistent ... proprietor of Green Wine.

When [Red]'s sales increase, our sales decrease.","[Red]'s lack of business knowledge is surprisingly destructive in this market.

Despite our differences, I ... do not believe him capable of murder."],"motiveBlackGuilty":["[Black] and I were long-time friends.  I understand he came to hate me and this town for their views on religion. | I no longer know what he is capable of anymore.","[Black] was not my first choice for town friar, despite our history.

He has quite the drunken tendencies, but his heart is in the right place.","[Blue] is ... special.  Despite this, his services are much appreciated."],"motiveBlueGuilty":["[Blue] is perhaps the one person who can make drinking Green Wine seem low class.  I do not appreciate this.","[Blue] is perhaps the least educated person with a say-so in town hall.","[Blue] is the only man I can imagine who can have such political power and drunkenly ... misunderstand how to use it."],"motiveVictimGreenInnocent":["[Victim] is my personal doctor; he is very ... discrete. | I use- %pardon me,% used him since he could be expedited if needed, and his services are second to none."],"motiveVictimGreenGuilty":["[Victim] may have been my personal doctor, but I assure you that it was purely ... out of necessity."],"motiveVictimYellowInnocent":["[Yellow]'s husband was a patient of [Victim].
