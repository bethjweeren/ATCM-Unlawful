Kindness doesn't pay for itself."],"openers":["Welcome back, honey!  What can I get you?","You look starved, honey.  You shouldn't work so hard.","Honey, take a break.  You seem like you need it."],"openersMorning":["Oh, good morning deary!  What can I get you?"],"openersDay":["Good to see you again, deary. | I just finished baking a batch of bread. How can I help you?"],"openersNight":["I've already closed up for the day, sorry honey. | But what can I help you with anyway?"],"closers":["Leaving already?  Well good luck."],"closersNight":["It seems like you've been working for awhile.  Maybe you should take a dinner break, deary."],"itemYes":["That is correct.  What are you implying, detective?","Of course I ... have [Weapon], detective.  Don't you?","I own many things, detective.  Including a company that has a need for [Weapon]."],"itemNo":["Oh, I may have had [Weapon] once, but I don't have [Weapon] anymore.","Oh, I lost [Weapon] weeks ago, honey.","Say what you will, but I actually don't have [Weapon], honey."],"itemBut":["Oh, that reminds me!  I saw [Suspect] with [Weapon] the other day!","Speaking of which, did you hear that [Suspect] has [Weapon]?  I know, right?  Never really trusted [Suspect].","Oh, have you heard what they're saying?  [Suspect] supposedly has [Weapon] also.  I heard that [Suspect] knows how to use it, too."],"startHintYes":["Oh, how horrid!  I can't believe that someone would do such a thing! | I'd hate to mention anyone by name, but it's the only place I can think to start, dear. | I think that [Suspect] has [Weapon].  Just please don't tell [Suspect] that I brought that up!"],"startHintNo":["Oh, how horrid!  I can't believe that someone would do such a thing! | I'm so sorry, honey.  I would have no idea where to start on this case."],"motiveGreenInnocent":["Oh, [Green]?  He's the proprietor of the rich and enrichening Green Wine, honey. | I hardly have something bad to say about him when his wine all but funds Yellow Bakery.","Oh yes, [Green] is a doll!  He even gives me discounts for ordering so much Green Wine each week, the sweet thing.","[Green] keeps up with many of the businesses around town despite his busy schedule.  It reminds me of how I like to run my business!"],"motiveGreenGuilty":["The townsfolk seem to love [Green]'s wine, but it's been hurting people's appetites for months now. | I'd personally prefer if people would just focus on answering their hunger.  Does that make sense?","[Green]?  I wish I could, but if I slander [Green], then it could affect wine shipment prices.  Sorry honey.","Oh honey.  [Green] may one day run this town, but I'd hardly ask for it. | He'd focus on business first and people second.  Far too detatched for my liking."],"motiveYellowInnocent":["You already know me, honey.  I'm [Yellow], your local baker! | I learned to bake when I happily married Mr. Yellow.  I became a full-time baker after Mr. Yellow died. | But don't listen to me, I've found my ways to cope.  Luckily baking is one of them!"],"motiveYellowGuilty":[null],"motiveRedInnocent":["What a doll, that [Red]!  It's not often to see a hard-working female with such success around here.","[Red] has skill with her hands like you wouldn't believe! | I simply must use her practical crafts to get through the day.","[Red]?  Honey, her success is tied with mine.  She brings in foot traffic like you wouldn't believe.  "],"motiveRedGuilty":["[Red] brings a lot of foot traffic, but that foot traffic is often too full on chocolate to buy anything. | If Red just sold things in my store instead of at my doorstep, then none of that would happen.","Don't get me wrong, honey.  [Red] seems sweet, but her competition is draining. | If she just didn't sell things at my doorstep then we'd all be so much happier!","[Red] is my competition, yet she's gotten me hooked on her supplies. | Customers are people too, honey.  She doesn't have the right to taunt me while I pay her."],"motiveBlackInnocent":["[Black] has always been a lovely customer, dear.  He even uses my bread during mass!","[Black] may seem harsh, but he's a real person when you get to speaking to him. | I know!  It surprised me too!","I was surprised to find out [Black]'s respect for bread and breadmaking.  A bit surprising, but appreciated! | Guess it goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.  Right, honey?"],"motiveBlackGuilty":["[Black] chases away all the kind folk around here day in and day out. | Maybe if he yelled less, then more people would visit his church.","Customers have told me that [Black] has kept them from wanting to come by my store since they might run into him.  He's a leech on happiness, darling.","If I'm honest, honey, [Black] so often calls me out for being an atheist that I have to avoid the town square most afternoons."],"motiveBlueInnocent":["[Blue] is a friend of mine!  He's always so nice to me, if a little overbearing.","Not only does [Blue] purchase wine from me all the time, but he's actually very sweet, if a bit overbearing.","[Blue] and I have spent a lot of time together lately.  He's very direct and, a little lewd, but if you can get past that, he's a sweet man."],"motiveBlueGuilty":["[Blue] is very kind to me, but he seems a bit disconnected.  Sometimes, he feels like an entirely different person. | ...I worry about that man's mind sometime.","[Blue] is kind, but he can't accept that I am only interested in friendship right now.  There's nothing wrong with just enjoying each other's company, honey.","Oh dear.  To me, [Blue] seems a bit overbearing.  He often interrupts my work to hit on me. | I wish that he would just leave me alone sometimes."],"motiveVictimGreenInnocent":["I don't know about their personal relationship, but I know that [Victim] only comes into town when [Green] expedites him. | [Green] must really prefer [Victim] to be his doctor.  Don't you think, honey?"],"motiveVictimGreenGuilty":["Well, I really shouldn't be saying anything, dearie.  But, [Victim] and [Green] were at odds over [Green]'s buisness."],"motiveVictimYellowInnocent":["[Victim]? Oh, yes. They tried their hardest to save my husband... | I can't fault them, they stayed with us until my husband's final breath. | I'm sorry dearie, that was a tad somber. Anything else?"],"motiveVictimYellowGuilty":["He seems like a kind man.  However, %and pardon my bluntness, honey,% [Victim] is not a good doctor. | He is what we had though.  I doubt anyone is looking forward to the upcoming months without a doctor."],"motiveVictimRedInnocent":["Oh, those two got along well enough.  [Victim] always seemed to buy something from her."],"motiveVictimRedGuilty":["I really should say aything, but... | Well, [Victim] was very outspoken and an athiest.  You know [Red], hot tempered and religious.  I can't imagine their conversations lasting long."],"motiveVictimBlackInnocent":["Ah, yes, the friar didn't seem to have any major problems with [Victim]. | In fact, he seemed less sour than usual when [Victim] was in town.  Probably took some of the stress of death off his mind."],"motiveVictimBlackGuilty":["[Victim] was an athiest, not that there's anything wrong with that of course. | Well, in anycase, [Black] and [Victim] didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things."],"motiveVictimBlueInnocent":["[Blue] always seemed to take more time off at my bakery when [Victim] came around. | I think he felt more relaxed knowing someone else was handling the pressure of the townsfolk.  "],"motiveVictimBlueGuilty":["Oh, that [Blue].  His face turns red as an apple when he sees [Victim] come by my bakery. | [Victim]'s always been very nice to me and shows me a lot of respect.  I can't imagine why [Blue] wouldn't like him."],"opportunityGreenGuilty":["[Green] was supposed to stop by to talk business but I must of just missed him. | Do you think he's upset deary?"],"opportunityGreenInnocent":["Oh no!  I just remembered that I was supposed to meet him that night! | He was probably trying to reach me at the bakery, I'm sure deary."],"opportunityYellowGuilty":["I was heading to the graveyard that night, deary.  I hadn't been to see Mr. Yellow in some time..."],"opportunityYellowInnocent":["I was heading to the graveyard that night, deary.  I hadn't been to see Mr. Yellow in some time..."],"opportunityRedGuilty":["Oh, [Red]?  I believe I saw her painting while I was out tonight. | She must have really been inspired to be working that late."],"opportunityRedInnocent":["I saw her in an alley working on something on my way to the graveyard honey. | Have you bought any of her merchandise? She is simply amazing at what she does."],"opportunityBlackGuilty":["I think I saw him somewhere near the [Location]. | Oh dear, I thought he was in for a devotional that night?"],"opportunityBlackInnocent":["You're asking about [Black] dear? I saw him in the church while I was walking by."],"opportunityBlueGuilty":["I did not see [Blue], sorry honey. | He recently made a big purchase of wine so I'm sure he was just busy drinking."],"opportunityBlueInnocent":["Honey, knowing [Blue] he was probably passed out. The poor fellow. "],"dunno":["Oh no, sorry dearier. I haven't a clue."]}
